# Arlo Folder Reorganization

## 📁 What Was The Arlo Folder?

The `/arlo` folder contained a **Linux Voice Assistant (LVA)** project - an offline, privacy-focused voice assistant designed to run on Orange Pi 3B+ in Docker.

**Original Structure**:
```
arlo/
├── docker-compose.yml
└── LVA/
    ├── README.md
    ├── docker-compose.yml
    ├── .env.example
    └── lva_audio_test.py
```

---

## 🎯 New Professional Structure

The LVA service has been **reorganized as a deployment example** within the new AnnoGrid structure:

```
services/
└── deployments/
    ├── README.md (main deployment guide)
    ├── voice-assistant-lva.md (complete documentation)
    └── voice-assistant/
        ├── docker-compose.yml
        ├── .env.example
        └── lva_audio_test.py
```

## ✨ Benefits of Reorganization

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Location** | Root `/arlo` | Organized in `/services/deployments/` |
| **Documentation** | Scattered | Comprehensive guide in `voice-assistant-lva.md` |
| **Integration** | Isolated | Part of broader service deployment strategy |
| **Discoverability** | Hidden | Listed in `services/deployments/README.md` |
| **Maintenance** | Unclear | Clear node assignment (`anno-app-opi3bp-01`) |
| **Scaling** | Not planned | Easy to deploy multiple instances |

## 🚀 How to Use Voice Assistant Now

### Deploy on App Node

```bash
# SSH to app node
ssh pi@anno-app-opi3bp-01.local

# Navigate to service
cd /path/to/annogrid/services/deployments/voice-assistant

# Setup
cp .env.example .env
nano .env  # Configure audio backend

# Deploy
docker compose up -d

# Verify
docker compose logs -f linux-voice-assistant
```

### Access via REST API

```bash
# Local network
curl http://anno-app-opi3bp-01.local:8080/api/status

# Tailscale VPN
curl http://100.x.x.x:8080/api/status

# External (Cloudflare Tunnel)
curl https://voice.yourdomain.com/api/status
```

### Integrate with Home Assistant

Add to Home Assistant's `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
intent_script:
  voice_command:
    action:
      service: rest_command.execute_voice_action
      data_template:
        command: "{{ trigger.payload_json.text }}"
```

## 🔄 Migration Path

If you were using the old Arlo setup:

### Step 1: Backup Current Configuration

```bash
cd arlo/LVA
docker compose down  # Stop current service
cp -r . ~/lva-backup/  # Backup everything
```

### Step 2: Copy to New Location

```bash
cp -r arlo/LVA/* services/deployments/voice-assistant/
```

### Step 3: Update Configuration

```bash
cd services/deployments/voice-assistant
# Edit .env with your settings
nano .env
```

### Step 4: Deploy from New Location

```bash
docker compose up -d
docker compose logs -f linux-voice-assistant
```

### Step 5: Verify Integration

```bash
# Check it's monitoring
curl http://localhost:9100/metrics | grep lva

# Check it's discoverable
# It should appear in Prometheus targets
```
